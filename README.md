# Threshold visual detection task

This is a repository for a MATLAB implementation of a threshold visual 
detection task to be used in neurophysiological research. The task has been 
developed at the Neuroscience Center of University of Helsinki in the 
research groups of Matias Palva and Satu Palva. The groups have a long 
history of performing threshold detection tasks [1–7], and there are 
several different version of the basic experiment. This particular 
implementation has been written by Tuomas Puoliväli with two upcoming 
experiments in mind, one focused on circadian rhythms and one on 
closed-loop stimulation. Compared to the previous studies, the current 
task is most similar to the versions used in [4] and [7].

The task is built using <a href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">PsychToolbox</a> 
and <a href="http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/">Palamedes</a>. There are also 
functions for <a href="http://vpixx.com/products/tools-for-vision-sciences/display-drivers/datapixx/">DataPixx</a>
from VPixx Technologies.
